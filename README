To compile for the first time:
When opening Intellij Ultimate, use the bottom choice "Check out from Version Control", you need Git installed.
Select GitHub and enter the repository URL "https://github.com/samarmstrong111/RentalcarsApplicationWithREST.git".
Clone into your projects.
Once the project opens, press "alt+1" to open the project view.
Go into file->project setings and select your jdk.
Click the symbol in the very bottom left of the window to open up a bunch of other menus.
On the right of the screen there will be a tab for "Gradle"
Click this and then the sync option.
Finally, under libraries scroll until you find javax.json-1.0.4 and right click on it.
Click "Load/Unload Modules" at the bottom.
Click load all and ok, then the program should compile.
If javax.json doesn't appear in the libraries then go to file->project structure->libraries.
Here, scroll down until you find the package. Right click it then Add to Modules and select all then it should compile.

To view the output go to localhost:8080/ and then any of the following:
For the first part: "Price"
For the second part: "SIPP"
For the third part: "CarTypeBySupplier"
For the final part: "CarScore"

This code must be ran inside of the environment currently, as .jar compilations don't seem to be correctly exported.

If localhost:8080 doesn't work then you'll have to clear whatever is listening on the port first.
